# GENERATIVE-AI-CHATBOT

In this project, I developed an intelligent chatbot using the Mistral 7B Large Language Model (LLM), known for its advanced generative capabilities. The core idea was to leverage this LLM for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as:

1. Text generation: The chatbot can produce coherent and contextually relevant text based on user input.
2. Question answering: It handles user queries effectively, providing accurate and context-aware responses.

# Backend:
created a robust backend with Flask, a Python web framework that provides the server-side functionality to interact with the LLM. 
Flask manages the requests from the front end, processes them, and sends the user input to the Mistral LLM for generation. It handles:

Routing requests.
Managing the flow between the userâ€™s input and the model.
Returning the output generated by the LLM to the front end.

# Frontend:
The frontend was built with HTML, making the chatbot user-friendly and accessible. The user interface allows easy communication with the chatbot, offering a smooth user experience with features like:

1. Input text box: Where users can type their questions or requests.
2. Response display: Showing the generated text or answers.

# Generative AI Functionalities:
By integrating the Mistral 7B LLM, the chatbot demonstrated the following generative AI features:

Generating natural and fluent text: Based on the given prompts.
Understanding context: Handling complex conversations or queries and generating responses accordingly.
Versatility in NLP tasks: Not only limited to simple conversations but extending to generating summaries, answering factual questions, and more.
